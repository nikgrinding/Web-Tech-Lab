# Web Technology Lab

This repository contains all lab assignments completed during the Web Technology course. The labs progressively cover fundamental web development concepts from static HTML/CSS to full-stack applications with React and Node.js.

## Course Overview

The labs demonstrate proficiency in:
- **Frontend Development**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React
- **Backend Development**: Node.js, HTTP servers, file system operations
- **API Integration**: REST APIs, asynchronous data fetching
- **Modern Web Tools**: React Router, React Bootstrap, Vite
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless functions and static hosting

## Labs Summary

### Lab 1: HTML & CSS Fundamentals
Static resume and CV webpages demonstrating semantic HTML structure, CSS styling, responsive design, and professional layout techniques.

### Lab 2: JavaScript & API Integration
Weather application using OpenWeatherMap API with real-time data fetching, DOM manipulation, and dynamic UI updates based on weather conditions.

### Lab 3: Form Validation
Registration form with client-side JavaScript validation, real-time error feedback, and pattern matching for email, phone, and age validation.

### Lab 4: React Components & Props
React application showcasing functional components, props-based data flow, component hierarchy, and list rendering without state management.

### Lab 5: React State Management
Temperature converter demonstrating React hooks (useState), event handling, component interaction, and real-time Celsius/Fahrenheit conversion.

### Lab 6: React Lifecycle & Effects
Countdown timer using useEffect for interval management, controlled form inputs, state management, and proper cleanup functions.

### Lab 7: React Router & Navigation
Multi-page portfolio application with client-side routing, nested components, and integration of previous lab projects (Labs 5 & 6).

### Lab 8: React Bootstrap & External APIs
Blog dashboard with React Bootstrap components, JSONPlaceholder API integration, responsive grid layouts, and dynamic card rendering.

### Lab 9: Node.js HTTP Server
Vanilla Node.js server with custom routing, modular architecture, dynamic HTML generation, and server-side rendering without frameworks.

### Lab 10: File System Operations
Node.js application demonstrating asynchronous file reading, error logging, static file serving, and proper Content-Type header handling.

## Project Structure

Each lab is contained in its own directory with complete documentation:
- `lab-1/` through `lab-10/`: Individual lab projects
- `lab-9-vercel/`, `lab-10-vercel/`: Vercel-adapted versions for serverless deployment

## Getting Started

Each lab contains its own README with setup instructions. Generally:

**For static labs (1-3):**
```bash
cd lab-X
# Open HTML files directly in browser
```

**For React labs (4-8):**
```bash
cd lab-X
npm install
npm run dev
```

**For Node.js labs (9-10):**
```bash
cd lab-X
node server.cjs
```

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Building responsive, accessible web interfaces
- Managing application state and side effects in React
- Implementing client-side routing for SPAs
- Integrating third-party APIs and handling async operations
- Creating custom Node.js servers and routing logic
- Working with file systems and error handling
- Deploying applications to production environments
- Writing modular, maintainable code
